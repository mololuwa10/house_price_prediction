## Overview
Predicting house prices is a key application in real estate and finance. This project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data, extract insights, and make accurate price predictions. The dataset includes features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and other relevant variables.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data entries.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical data, and feature selection.
- **Model Training**: Using regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared are used to assess model performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mololuwa10/house_price_prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd house_price_prediction
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the notebook file `house_price_prediction.ipynb` step by step.
3. Modify or experiment with the code to test additional models or features.
